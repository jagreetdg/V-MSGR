-> TO START THE SERVER :  Execute Server_Main.class
-> TO REGISTER AS A CLIENT : Execute Client_Main.class
-> TO START UI MODE : Execute UI.class (Recommended for new users)
The rest of the UI is quite user friendly...you shouldn't have any trouble using V_MSGR
Notes :
1) Only one server instance should be run at a time
2) Multiple client instances can be run simultaneously
3) File sharing feature is under beta development stage.
